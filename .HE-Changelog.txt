Minor update trying to fix the stress issue. 
More mood/stress reworks incoming later

[b]Additions:[/b]
[List]
[*] Added some pasta meals: Spaghetti and meatballs, MudRamen, Toasty Ravioli, Mac and Cheese
[*] You can now find a very special Couwola collector item...
[/List]

[b]Changes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Reworked/Fixed Stress sometimes building up extremely fast. Stress buildup from negative actions (getting attacked) now has a cooldown, preventing very fast damaging weapons like welding tools from triggering stress 10 times per second.
[*] Added a hint treatment icon for stress
[*] Being drunk gives minor radiation resistance (apparently it's a thing)
[*] Increased slots for cutting board, oven and stove by 1
[/List]

[b]Fixes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Fix some talent text
[*] Fix blender inventory not stacking (couldnt make muesli by itself)
[*] Allow popped popnut to be used in research table
[/List]


[b]KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:[/b]
[*] Bad bot support. It is NOT advised giving bots NEEDS.
[*] Fabricators delete ingredient items instead of setting their condition to 0, preventing ingredients from turning empty/dirty (like bottles)
[*] Poisons are not working for fork/spoon/fingerfood meals
[*] Sprites of items INSIDE items INSIDE tables break and do not match their real position in the inventory
