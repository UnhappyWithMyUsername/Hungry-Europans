[b]Additions:[/b]
[List]
[*] Added "Mobile Dishwasher" which can be used to clean more tableware at once

[*] Added "Bag of Dishwasher Tablets" which contains 10 dishwasher tablets
[/List]

[b]Changes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Changed/Fixed power transfer for kitchen counter and kitchen pantry. Features a power_in and power_out (like relays). MAKE SURE TO REWIRE YOUR KITCHEN
[*] Changed how alcohol is applied by drinks. Stronger drinks will now make you drunk quicker
[*] Changed Beds and Sleeping:
[*] Resting in a bed (not sleeping) only reduces Nausea/Concussion/Drunk, but much faster than before
[*] Sleeping in a bed heals damage slowly, but also addictions and withdrawal faster than before
[*] Changed sleep overlay so you can see around your character a little
[*] Changed worm and tapeworm infection to be detectable instantly via health scanner (previously only showed starting at 10%)
[/List]

[b]Fixes:[/b] 
[List]

[*] Fixed ice cream not freezing in refrigerators
[*] Fixed cannibals being unable to speak
[*] Fixed projectiles spawning in the deconstructor when deconstructing the bananagun

[b]KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:[/b]
[*] Bad bot support. Bots cannot heal hunger/thirst without losing health first, so it's not advised giving bots NEEDS
[*] Damage multipliers (like steroids) result in less meat being harvested on corpses
[*] Fabricators delete ingredient items instead of setting their condition to 0, preventing ingredients from turning empty/dirty 
[*] Sprites of items INSIDE items INSIDE tables break and do not match their real position in the inventory

Misc TODOs:

- Find a way to use lower condition meat since under 50% it can't be used to cook. Maybe throw it out the depth charge tube as decoy? 
- Rework alcoholic to reduce and potentially remove the disoriented from being drunk.
- Change drunkness to not apply disoriented while in water and instead slow the character down
- Ethanol gives some radiation resistance
- Rework alcohol to invert controls less on lower to mid drunkness like drunknodebuffs and only really get annoying at high drunkness to compensate for high damage resistance.
- Fix meat spoiling in fabricators.
- Endworm and Watcher products giving "concealed" affliction to passivy creatures.
- Make tea kettle storable in cafeteria cart



LIST OF FOODS IDEAS:

- Sauté with Mushrooms, mushroom recipes
- Paté/Foie Gras. Made with Offal, can be spread on bread slices
- Cake + Cake Slice
- Pasta + pasta recipes
- Chewing gum. Made from elastin. Reduces effects of hunger and prevents it from increasing.
- Endeavour's cuppa: minor healing properties, slow metabolism cures psychosis and hallucinations, cures husk 
- Grog! It'd be made of sea water and rum.
- Homemade kvass from water, bread, yeast and sugar.
- Gravy (water, flour, salt, pepper, broth?)
- Cookie jar
- Radioactive sausage cooked in reactor
- Burger Double Deluxe (burger with 2x patties and cheese)
- Box of Fiber Plant cereals, bowl of cereals + milk





Enforced NEEDS:
- Changes to the lua function. Mainly important for singleplayer or multiplayer with bots:
Bots will now only get the "Hungry Europan" talent and thus the hunger and thirst afflictions if you actively control them. Hunger and thirst values will be stored and then set to 0 for characters controlled by a bot. Upon taking back control over the character, the previous hunger and thirst values for this specific character will be restored. Switching into the next round will however delete all stored values that are currently not in use so always switch back to your main character or your hunger and thirst will be reset to 0.

Deathwish: Fix controller component showing when interacting with surgical table on stimpy subs

NEEDS:
- Updated to the latest version of Hungry Europans. See changelogs [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2954998725]HERE[/url]



LongTermPlans:
- Meat Cleaver sharpening + Whetstone - prevents players from harvesting too much meat in one go
- Blender and juices
- Canned food. Canned food from earth, requires can opener or knife to open. Figure out something to do with it.
	Can Opener: 100% | No injuries
	Diving Knife: 80% | 10% chance of lacerations	
- "Constipated" affliction. Caused by eating elastin and prevents you from pooping which will result in constantly increasing organ damage (And/Or custom bowel rupture affliction) until death if not treated.
- Kuru sickness
- "Brain freeze" from eating ice cream too fast
- Meat Chunks cookable and burnable in open fires.
- More recipes and unlockable recipes by recipe items found or bought.
- Abyssal meats?
- Plant based talents. Craftable item that makes items grow faster? Special fertilizer?
- Better Entertainer talents to replace the whole "graduation" copy
- Tier 4 talents for butcher (choice): 1. cannibalism buff with butcher saw. Can directly harvest abyssal meat. | 2. Meat tenderizer hammer (two handed blunt weapon). Will allow meat cleaver to harvest abyssal creature meat after hitting their corpse a few times.
- Assistant "Tasty target" talent for Chef
- Unique Couwola location with cola bottle plant and a locked, run down old part of the station and questline to obtain access to it and grab special bottles for the Couwola Cola collector to obtain his Limited Edition Exosuit.
