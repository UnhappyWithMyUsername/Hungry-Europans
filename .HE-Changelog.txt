Balance update: 
Trying to reduce the overall meat and meat values from enemies to a more reasonable level. The amount of meat harvested and hunger cured by raw meat has never been balanced since the meat cleaver was reworked months ago. Some food fabrication recipes also gave way more items than intended (nuggets, jerky)

[b]Additions:[/b]
[List]
[*] Added Fruity Bowl (something to use your 200 bananas on)
[*] Added Elastin Gum
[/List]

[b]Changes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Buffed some of the weaker talents, some with new effects (Delicacies, Master Brewer, Short Order, Dry Aging, Master Chef uniform)
[*] Meat Cleaver no longer despawns enemy corpses. Disappearing medium to large enemies looked very weird. Instead it now plays a sound when you can no longer harvest meat from a corpse.
[*] Meat Cleaver loses condition when hitting an enemy corpse that can be butchered. If the cleaver does not lose condition, it means the corpse can no longer drop meat.
[*] Meat Cleaver can be sharpened at a fabricator to reset its condition and get minor quality bonuses
[*] Basic Meat Cleaver fabrication cost increased
[*] Meat cleaver inflicts more "butchered" which should reduce the overall meat gathered from enemies, especially smaller/basic ones which gave too much meat
[*] Nerfed nuggets by a lot (previously, a single raw meat would give you 96 hunger worth of nuggets)
[*] Nerf Jerky recipe output from 8 to 1 (it gave 8x too much jerky)
[*] Jerky can now stack
[*] Increase Hammerhead ribs required ingredients from 1 to 3 (it gave 3x too many ribs)
[*] Nerf Meat patty recipe output from 2 to 1 (you could make 16 patties with a single crawler)
[*] Increase watering can water usage
[*] Changed the black screen effect from being stunned, you can now see a little
[*] Some recipe changes use more input and give more output at once to reduce craft times
[*] Simplified husk recipes (disabled raw husk lump)

[/List]

[b]Fixes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Fix several duplicate recipes in cafeteria/vending machine (bowls, energy drinks...)
[*] Fix dough/tea/coffee recipes having weird drinks as valid ingredients
[*] Fix kitchen counter sprite looking disassembled when attached
[*] Fix soup pots of excellent/masterwork quality not spawning soup (the quality only affects the chance of getting worm parasites)
[*] Fix stack of bowls being deleted when inserted inside soup pots
[/List]


[b]KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:[/b]
[*] Bad bot support. It is NOT advised giving bots NEEDS.
[*] Fabricators delete ingredient items instead of setting their condition to 0, preventing ingredients from turning empty/dirty 
[*] Poisons are not working for fork/spoon/fingerfood meals
[*] Sprites of items INSIDE items INSIDE tables break and do not match their real position in the inventory

Misc TODOs:

- Rework alcoholic to reduce and potentially remove the disoriented from being drunk.
- Change drunkness to not apply disoriented while in water and instead slow the character down
- Ethanol gives some radiation resistance
- Rework alcohol to invert controls less on lower to mid drunkness like drunknodebuffs and only really get annoying at high drunkness to compensate for high damage resistance.
- Fix meat spoiling in fabricators.
- Make tea kettle storable in cafeteria cart



LIST OF FOODS IDEAS:

- Mantis/Orange boy meat and meals, basically a lobster/crab
Mantis Surimi, Tempura (fried food)... 
- More Blender recipes
- More Offal recipes
- More Mushroom recipes?
- Cookie jar
- Cake + Slices
- Pasta + pasta recipes
- Chewing gum. Made from elastin. Slows down hunger but accelerates need to defecate if too high?
- Endeavour's cuppa: minor healing properties, slow metabolism cures psychosis and hallucinations, cures husk 
- Grog! It'd be made of sea water and rum.
- Homemade kvass from water, bread, yeast and sugar.
- Burger Double Deluxe (burger with 2x patties and cheese)





Enforced NEEDS:
- Changes to the lua function. Mainly important for singleplayer or multiplayer with bots:
Bots will now only get the "Hungry Europan" talent and thus the hunger and thirst afflictions if you actively control them. Hunger and thirst values will be stored and then set to 0 for characters controlled by a bot. Upon taking back control over the character, the previous hunger and thirst values for this specific character will be restored. Switching into the next round will however delete all stored values that are currently not in use so always switch back to your main character or your hunger and thirst will be reset to 0.

Deathwish: Fix controller component showing when interacting with surgical table on stimpy subs

NEEDS:
- Updated to the latest version of Hungry Europans. See changelogs [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2954998725]HERE[/url]



LongTermPlans:
- Meat Cleaver sharpening + Whetstone - prevents players from harvesting too much meat in one go
- Blender and juices
- Canned food. Canned food from earth, requires can opener or knife to open. Figure out something to do with it.
	Can Opener: 100% | No injuries
	Diving Knife: 80% | 10% chance of lacerations	
- "Constipated" affliction. Caused by eating elastin and prevents you from pooping which will result in constantly increasing organ damage (And/Or custom bowel rupture affliction) until death if not treated.
- Kuru sickness
- "Brain freeze" from eating ice cream too fast
- Meat Chunks cookable and burnable in open fires.
- More recipes and unlockable recipes by recipe items found or bought.
- Abyssal meats?
- Plant based talents. Craftable item that makes items grow faster? Special fertilizer?
- Better Entertainer talents to replace the whole "graduation" copy
- Tier 4 talents for butcher (choice): 1. cannibalism buff with butcher saw. Can directly harvest abyssal meat. | 2. Meat tenderizer hammer (two handed blunt weapon). Will allow meat cleaver to harvest abyssal creature meat after hitting their corpse a few times.
- Assistant "Tasty target" talent for Chef
- Unique Couwola location with cola bottle plant and a locked, run down old part of the station and questline to obtain access to it and grab special bottles for the Couwola Cola collector to obtain his Limited Edition Exosuit.
