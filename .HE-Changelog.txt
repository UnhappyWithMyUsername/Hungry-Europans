- (WIP) Added: New drinks "Hot Chocolate". Increases your tiredness if you have it enabled, but also increases your mood and helps to sober up
- Added: New output for "Hydroponic Planter" to calculate the seconds until the next produce. Works exactly like the "Gardening Sprinkler"
- (TODO) Added: New optional affliction "Hygiene" which is enabled with the "Filthy Europan" item

- (WIP) Added "Electric Grill". Used to cook multiple meats simultaneously
- (TODO) Rework of almost all meat related recipes. For example burgers and hotdogs will now be put together on the cutting board while the meat is cooked seperately on the stove with either a pan or cooking pot
- Rescaled burgers and hotdogs. They felt a bit oversized previously
- Severely reduced amount of alien blood gained from deconstructing meat
- Removed the override for "Adrenaline" since the vanilla game now cures stun with it by default
- Disabled "Starvation Conciousness Regainer" from spawning purchasing and crafting since you can just feed someone unconcious with regular food and drinks to help them out
- Made empty cans spawn in or nearby outpost trash cans

Enforced:

- Changes to the lua function. Mainly important for singleplayer or multiplayer with bots:
Bots will now only get the "Hungry Europan" talent and thus the hunger and thirst afflictions if you actively control them. Hunger and thirst values will be stored and then set to 0 for characters controlled by a bot. Upon taking back control over the character, the previous hunger and thirst values for this specific character will be restored. Switching into the next round will however delete all stored values that are currently not in use so always switch back to your main character or your hunger and thirst will be reset to 0.


Also, M, please, make a crafting recipe for the fryer consisting of 5 water bottles. it crafts instantly and spawns a proxy item that causes fryer to explode.
It should deal serious burn damage
Like you literally dumped 5 bottles of cold water into a fryer
This should cause some troubles i believe

Deathwish: Fix controller component showing when interacting with surgical table on stimpy subs
ToDo - Current Update:
- algae protein cakes from vending machines as mentioned in bot convos.

- Check Discord DMs from ED for talent stuff

- Change lunch box recipe to 1x aluminum + 1x plastic and increase price accordingly
- Make items in lunch boxes non-stackable
- Change jam to be eatable by itself / make the jar emptyable and increase the required jam amount for sandwiches to 0.124
- Make jams non-stackable like other jar items
- Add Poutine
- Ethanol gives some radiation resistance
- Rework alcohol to invert controls less on lower to mid drunkness like drunknodebuffs and only really get annoying at high drunkness to compensate for high damage resistance.
- Clown Juice gives stun resistance.
- Coalition Premium gives ranged spread reduction or sellmultiplier <StatValue stattype="RangedSpreadReduction" minvalue="0.25" maxvalue="0.5" /> <StatValue stattype="StoreSellMultiplier" minvalue="0.25" maxvalue="0.5" />

- Canned food. Requires can opener, knife or boarding axe to open. Explodes after being in fire for a while.
	Can Opener: 100% | No injuries
	Diving Knife: 80% | 10% chance of lacerations
	Meat Cleaver: 60% | 30% chance of lacerations
	Boarding Axe: 20% | 50% chance of lacerations

# Moloch sushi.
- Grog! It'd be made of sea water and rum.
- Make Kegs sellable.
- Soups
- Endworm and Watcher products giving "concealed" affliction to passivy creatures.

fries by themselves could be made via cutting board, using 2 pomegrenade, 10% salt and 10% pepper, and are afterwards used in the frier with cooking oil (25% is what I advise because its the same amount for nuggets and such). Fries would have similar properties to pomegrenade chips ig.

gravy irl tends to be relatively up to personal preferences and families. But generally speaking, all of them require water, flour, salt and pepper, the last ingredients mostly being dependant to tastes. Non-vegan recipes tends to use broth, vegan recipes can use soy sauce, cornstarch, etc.
So the recipe I would advise would be 99% water bottle, 20% flour, 10% salt, 10% pepper, and maybe an additional ingredient depending if you feel like it
the recipes aren't realistic themselves, but they're tuned for in game balance
a batch of 5 fries and gravy would cost 1 salt, 1 pepper, 1 flour, 1.25 cooking oil (I don't like it but its made to be tuned around other frier recipes), 5 water and 10 pomegrenade 
maybe the additional ingredient for gravy could be a jar, since from my experience jars are only used for jams and delicacy no one craft because hammerhead meals tends to be better in term of cost and yeald
as for poutine itself, the idea I had about it if we want to give it a buff could be related to drink afflictions since poutine tends to be combo'd well with beer or sodas, so maybe giving it a buff to drinks buff



NEEDS:
- Updated to the latest version of Hungry Europans. See changelogs [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2954998725]HERE[/url]
