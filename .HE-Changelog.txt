Misc TODOs:

- Make tea kettle storable in cafeteria cart
- Rework alcoholic to reduce and potentially remove the disoriented from being drunk.
- Change drunkness to not apply disoriented while in water and instead slow the character down
- Skin for Poutine
- Ethanol gives some radiation resistance
- Rework alcohol to invert controls less on lower to mid drunkness like drunknodebuffs and only really get annoying at high drunkness to compensate for high damage resistance.
- Fix meat spoiling in fabricators.
- "Constipated" affliction. Caused by eating elastin and prevents you from pooping which will result in constantly increasing organ damage (And/Or custom bowel rupture affliction) until death if not treated.
- Endworm and Watcher products giving "concealed" affliction to passivy creatures.



LIST OF FOODS IDEAS:

- Thresher Saut√© with Mushrooms: thresher meat + mushroom
- Cake + Cake Slice
- Pasta + pasta recipes?
- Chewing gum. Made from elastin. Reduces effects of hunger and prevents it from increasing.
- Endeavour's cuppa: minor healing properties, slow metabolism cures psychosis and hallucinations, cures husk 
- Grog! It'd be made of sea water and rum.
- Homemade kvass from water, bread, yeast and sugar.
- Gravy (water, flour, salt, pepper, broth?)



Changelog: TODO: changelog is ultra outdated and I didn't take any notes :^)

- Fixed "Pomegrenade Jam" recipe having a wrong identifier for pomegrenades, causing performance issues when trying to craft it
- Fixed Refrigerators not being fireproof
- Added: "Sink" item. Now separated from the kitchen counter, it will allow you to refill bottles and clean dishes
- Added: "Pan" item. Required for cooking some recipes on the stove and can be used as a melee weapon
- Added: "Pot" item. Required for cooking some recipes on the stove
- Added: New tableware items including: Fork, Spoon, Cups, Plates, Bowls and their dirty variants
- Added: "Flour". Crafted from 30 seeds and "Sulphuric Acid"
- (TODO) Added: New ingredient "Dough" which is now used to make Bread, Buns and Pizza
- Added: New food item "Omelette" of every monster egg type (Crawler, Mudraptor, Thresher)
- Added: New food item "Pizza" + "Pizza Slice"
- (WIP) Added: New drinks "Coffee". Reduces your tiredness if you have it enabled and helps to sober up. Can give you a caffeine rush
- (WIP) Added: New drinks "Hot Chocolate". Increases your tiredness if you have it enabled, but also increases your mood and helps to sober up
- Added: New output for "Hydroponic Planter" to calculate the seconds until the next produce. Works exactly like the "Gardening Sprinkler"
- (TODO) Added: New optional affliction "Hygiene" which is enabled with the "Filthy Europan" item
- Changed: Regular Food is no longer stackable. Snacks can still be stacked to some extend
- Changed: "Bladder", "Need to defecate", "Stomach Ache" and "Alcohol Withdrawal" can now cause your mood to worsen (Only with "Mood" enabled)
- Changed: "Drunk" can now improve your mood (Only with "Mood" enabled)
- Changed: "Drunk" can now make you tired (Only with "Tiredness" enabled)
- Changed: "Coalition Premium" beer will now give a temporary buff that decreases the power usage of the turret you're operating by up to 50%
- Changed: "Jovian Force" beer will now give a temporary buff that increases the fire rate of the turret you're operating by up to 50%
- Changed: "Cafeteria Cart" is no longer attachable. Its inventory is accessed by using the "Action" keybind (Default "E") to bring it more in line with other modded items
- (TODO) Changed: All food and drink items now support "Tiredness" and "Mood" values
- Fixed: "Internal Burns" had wrong damage values and thus wouldn't actually cause any damage
- Fixed: Puking from "Stomach Ache" didn't decrease the duration of some food buffs
- Integrated: "Tiredness" and "Mood" from NEEDS. These are optional and can each be toggled via an item at vending machines or forced via a separately available "Enforcer" patch
- (WIP) Added "Electric Grill". Used to cook multiple meats simultaneously
- (TODO) Rework of almost all meat related recipes. For example burgers and hotdogs will now be put together on the cutting board while the meat is cooked seperately on the stove with either a pan or cooking pot
- Rescaled burgers and hotdogs. They felt a bit oversized previously
- Severely reduced amount of alien blood gained from deconstructing meat
- Removed the override for "Adrenaline" since the vanilla game now cures stun with it by default
- Disabled "Starvation Conciousness Regainer" from spawning purchasing and crafting since you can just feed someone unconcious with regular food and drinks to help them out
- Made empty cans spawn in or nearby outpost trash cans



Enforced NEEDS:
- Changes to the lua function. Mainly important for singleplayer or multiplayer with bots:
Bots will now only get the "Hungry Europan" talent and thus the hunger and thirst afflictions if you actively control them. Hunger and thirst values will be stored and then set to 0 for characters controlled by a bot. Upon taking back control over the character, the previous hunger and thirst values for this specific character will be restored. Switching into the next round will however delete all stored values that are currently not in use so always switch back to your main character or your hunger and thirst will be reset to 0.

Deathwish: Fix controller component showing when interacting with surgical table on stimpy subs

NEEDS:
- Updated to the latest version of Hungry Europans. See changelogs [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2954998725]HERE[/url]



LongTermPlans:
- Meat Cleaver sharpening + Whetstone - prevents players from harvesting too much meat in one go
- Canned food. Canned food from earth, requires can opener or knife to open. Figure out something to do with it.
	Can Opener: 100% | No injuries
	Diving Knife: 80% | 10% chance of lacerations
- Kuru sickness
- Meat Chunks cookable and burnable in open fires.
- More recipes and unlockable recipes by recipe items found or bought.
- Abyssal meats.
- Plant based talents. Craftable item that makes items grow faster? Special fertilizer?
- Tier 4 talents for butcher (choice): 1. cannibalism buff with butcher saw. Can directly harvest abyssal meat. | 2. Meat tenderizer hammer (two handed blunt weapon). Will allow meat cleaver to harvest abyssal creature meat after hitting their corpse a few times.
- Assistant "Tasty target" talent for Chef
- Unique Couwola location with cola bottle plant and a locked, run down old part of the station and questline to obtain access to it and grab special bottles for the Couwola Cola collector to obtain his Limited Edition Exosuit.


Here's my current list of what I want to add this month before pushing the content to the original Hungry Europans:
