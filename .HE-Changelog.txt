[b]MAJOR Changes:[/b]

[List]
[*] Rework of almost all meat related recipes to make use of all kitchen equipment. For example burgers and hotdogs will now be put together on the cutting board while the meat is cooked seperately in the oven or the stove with either a pan or cooking pot.
[*] A lot more kitchen equipment added. The kitchen counter has a power outlet (like a junction box) to help power them.
[*] Cutting board needs to be manually operated to function.
[*] Burgers, Hotdogs, MREs and other fast foods no longer have a (species) attribute. This was done to reduce the amount of item bloat in fabricators and medical UI. Fast food no longer gives food buffs. Expect error messages when loading an old save as those items have been deleted
[*] Food buffs reworked: buffs are no longer tied to species (example: mudraptor => damage resistance). Food buffs are more minor and depend on the recipe of the meal. More complex meals give more buffs.
[*] Most foods no longer stack to avoid accidentally eating the 2nd item in the stack after finishing the first one. Use lunchboxes to carry extra food.
[*] Integrated: "Tiredness" and "Mood" from NEEDS. These are optional and can each be toggled via an item at vending machines or forced via a separately available "Enforcer" patch
[*] Added: New optional affliction "Hygiene" which is enabled with the "Filthy Europan" item (partially bugged, is removed too easily)
[*] Added: Traits. You can select a preferred food and drink that will help improve your Mood when consumed
[*] Food quality and parasites: eating food has a small chance of giving you intestinal parasites. Cooking skill increases food quality: the higher the quality, the less likely your food will make you sick.
[*] Unit Load Devices can be swapped to make empty space for your kitchen.
[*] A lot of new text requiring translation. The English file is a mess though, will work on making translation easier in the future

[/List]

[b]New:[/b]

[List]
[*] Added: New tableware items including: Fork, Spoon, Cups, Plates, Bowls and their dirty variants
[*] Added: "Sink" kitchen item, now separated from the kitchen counter. Used to refill bottles and clean tableware
[*] Added: "Pan" item. Required for cooking some recipes on the stove and can be used as a melee weapon
[*] Added: "Pot" item. Required for cooking some recipes on the stove
[*] Added: "Electric Grill". Used to cook multiple meats simultaneously
[*] Added: "Flour". Crafted from seeds and sulphuric acid
[*] Added: "Dough". Used to make Bread, Buns and Pizza
[*] Added: "Pizza" + "Pizza Slice"
[*] Added: "Omelette" 
[*] Added: Soups and soup pots 
[*] Added: Various meals 
[*] Added: New distiller recipes for fermented foods, distiller should have more uses
[*] Added: Plant genetics and crossbreeding. Cross two fruits at a research station to obtain special seeds! 
[*] (WIP) Added: "Coffee". Reduces your tiredness if you have it enabled and helps to sober up. Can give you a caffeine rush
[*] (WIP) Added: "Hot Chocolate". Increases your tiredness if you have it enabled, but also increases your mood and helps to sober up
[*] Added Moloch Milking Tool
[*] Added NPC conversations, some related to food traits, being hungry, thirsty...
[*] Added 3 submarines with kitchen, courtesy of NotWendy
[/List]


[b]Other Changes:[/b]

[List]
[*] Some food and drink items need to be eaten in a specific way (opening bottles, opening jars, eating with fork/spoon...). Involves using RMB+E or RMB+E or tapping RMB, might not be intuitive though.
[*] Kitchen equipment sprites were changed to align with the counter when placed in-game. Old equipment might be offset as a result. 
[*] Machinery and planter pots use placement restrictions: cannot place these items in too close proximity to other items, can only be placed on the ground
[*] Deconstructing meat no longer gives Alien blood
[*] Plants are smaller and grow faster, but require more active watering and are more vulnerable to both flooding and fire
[*] Watering can needs to be refilled in a sink or by inserting a bottle of water
[*] Buffed some of the weaker Chef talents.
[*] "Bladder", "Need to defecate", "Stomach Ache" and "Alcohol Withdrawal" can now cause your mood to worsen (Only with "Mood" enabled)
[*] "Drunk" can now improve your mood (Only with "Mood" enabled)
[*] "Drunk" can now make you tired (Only with "Tiredness" enabled)
[*] "Cafeteria Cart" is no longer attachable. Its inventory is accessed by using the "Action" keybind (Default "E") to bring it more in line with other 
[*] New output for "Hydroponic Planter" to calculate the seconds until the next produce.
[*] Garden Sprinkler cycle rate can be set manually
[*] Rescaled burgers and hotdogs. They felt a bit oversized previously
[*] Made empty cans spawn in or nearby outpost trash cans
[*] "Hungry Europan" syringe gives you a starter 5 Cooking 5 Butchery
[*] Removed "Starvation Conciousness Regainer" since you can just feed someone unconcious or use adrenaline
[*] Removed the override for "Adrenaline" since the vanilla game now cures stun with it by default
[/List]

[b]Fixes:[/b] 

[List]
[*] Fixed "Pomegrenade Jam" recipe having a wrong identifier for pomegrenades, causing performance issues when trying to craft it
[*] Fixed Refrigerators not being fireproof
[*] Fixed: "Internal Burns" had wrong damage values and thus wouldn't actually cause any damage
[*] Fixed: Puking from "Stomach Ache" didn't decrease the duration of some food buffs
[/List]


[b]KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:[/b] 
[*] Bot support is iffy. Bots can't heal hunger/thirst without losing health (vanilla issue), so it's not advised giving bots NEEDS
[*] Errors for missing/deleted items. Just save once and the errors will go away.
[*] Damage multipliers (like steroids) result in less meat being harvested on corpses
[*] Not being able to wash off Hygiene affliction by going in the water without clothes
[*] Cleaning stacked bowls/plates in the sink will delete any contained bowl/plate
[*] Sprites of items inside items inside tables break and do not match their real position in the inventory 	
[*] Not being able to wash off Hygiene affliction by going in the water without clothes

Misc TODOs:

- Find a way to use lower condition meat since under 50% it can't be used to cook. Maybe throw it out the depth charge tube as decoy? 
- Rework alcoholic to reduce and potentially remove the disoriented from being drunk.
- Change drunkness to not apply disoriented while in water and instead slow the character down
- Skin for Poutine
- Ethanol gives some radiation resistance
- Rework alcohol to invert controls less on lower to mid drunkness like drunknodebuffs and only really get annoying at high drunkness to compensate for high damage resistance.
- Fix meat spoiling in fabricators.
- Endworm and Watcher products giving "concealed" affliction to passivy creatures.
- Make tea kettle storable in cafeteria cart



LIST OF FOODS IDEAS:

- Saut√© with Mushrooms: meat + mushroom
- Cake + Cake Slice
- Pasta + pasta recipes
- Chewing gum. Made from elastin. Reduces effects of hunger and prevents it from increasing.
- Endeavour's cuppa: minor healing properties, slow metabolism cures psychosis and hallucinations, cures husk 
- Grog! It'd be made of sea water and rum.
- Homemade kvass from water, bread, yeast and sugar.
- Gravy (water, flour, salt, pepper, broth?)
- Cookie jar





Enforced NEEDS:
- Changes to the lua function. Mainly important for singleplayer or multiplayer with bots:
Bots will now only get the "Hungry Europan" talent and thus the hunger and thirst afflictions if you actively control them. Hunger and thirst values will be stored and then set to 0 for characters controlled by a bot. Upon taking back control over the character, the previous hunger and thirst values for this specific character will be restored. Switching into the next round will however delete all stored values that are currently not in use so always switch back to your main character or your hunger and thirst will be reset to 0.

Deathwish: Fix controller component showing when interacting with surgical table on stimpy subs

NEEDS:
- Updated to the latest version of Hungry Europans. See changelogs [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2954998725]HERE[/url]



LongTermPlans:
- Meat Cleaver sharpening + Whetstone - prevents players from harvesting too much meat in one go
- Blender and juices
- Canned food. Canned food from earth, requires can opener or knife to open. Figure out something to do with it.
	Can Opener: 100% | No injuries
	Diving Knife: 80% | 10% chance of lacerations	
- "Constipated" affliction. Caused by eating elastin and prevents you from pooping which will result in constantly increasing organ damage (And/Or custom bowel rupture affliction) until death if not treated.
- Kuru sickness
- "Brain freeze" from eating ice cream too fast
- Meat Chunks cookable and burnable in open fires.
- More recipes and unlockable recipes by recipe items found or bought.
- Abyssal meats?
- Plant based talents. Craftable item that makes items grow faster? Special fertilizer?
- Better Entertainer talents to replace the whole "graduation" copy
- Tier 4 talents for butcher (choice): 1. cannibalism buff with butcher saw. Can directly harvest abyssal meat. | 2. Meat tenderizer hammer (two handed blunt weapon). Will allow meat cleaver to harvest abyssal creature meat after hitting their corpse a few times.
- Assistant "Tasty target" talent for Chef
- Unique Couwola location with cola bottle plant and a locked, run down old part of the station and questline to obtain access to it and grab special bottles for the Couwola Cola collector to obtain his Limited Edition Exosuit.
