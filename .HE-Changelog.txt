[b]Additions:[/b]
[List]
[*] Nothing :(
[/List]

[b]Changes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Improved Beer descriptions to hopefully clarify what they do
[*] Reaper's Tribute beer effects improved, now reduces Fatigue and heals slightly when passing out
[*] Very slightly reduced the amount of passive Fatigue gained (you would sleep more than you would eat in the HUNGRY mod)
[*] Fewer empty cans in outposts (less aluminium everywhere)
[*] Increased the amount of base cooking/butchery skill from injecting "Enable Hungry Europan" from 5 to 10
[*] Increased the amount of cooking/butchery skill from reading book, extra skill if you have low cooking/butchery, reading books improves mood
[*] Trying to apply bottles via Health UI (to heal infections/burns...) will unbottle them
[*] Enabled milking all Moloch (including babies), milking molochs will build milking immunity over time so there is a finite amount of milk you can get (use Health Scanner to keep track)
[*] Cheese recipe gives 2x more cheese, reduced cheese food value and cheese slices
[/List]

[b]Fixes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Fix lack of ambientlight on some subs
[*] Fix installation boxes taking damage from explosions and breaking
[*] Reduced cleaver "no meat" sound range, it was supposed to only play for the person swinging the cleaver but this didnt work as expected and the sound can be heard from far away.
[*] Fix blender not shaking
[*] Fix some containers not taking all types of eggs
[*] Fix popnut/berry leaves not going in the refrigerator
[*] Fix prepared roasts/filets decaying when out of refrigerator
[/List]


[b]KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:[/b]
[*] Bad bot support. It is NOT advised giving bots NEEDS.
[*] Fabricators delete ingredient items instead of setting their condition to 0, preventing ingredients from turning empty/dirty (like bottles)
[*] Poisons are not working for fork/spoon/fingerfood meals
[*] Sprites of items INSIDE items INSIDE tables break and do not match their real position in the inventory
