Balance changes

[b]Changes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Crafting costs for kitchen appliances rebalanced. Uses less Titanium alloy.
[*] Amount of fork/spoon uses required to eat meals reduced in general. It took too much time to eat those meals
[*] MRE food value nerfed
[*] Some cooked meals food value buffed/rebalanced
[*] Bread/Slices/Buns food values adjusted to be equivalent per 1 unit of Dough
[*] Bread food value reduced to match other bread products
[*] Bread no longer uses Sugar in its recipe
[*] Spare ribs use sugar instead of salt
[*] Drinks can no longer be combined as you could not drink from a combined bottle with 100% condition
[/List]

[b]Fixes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Fixed Dynamic Europa taking over Hungry Europans text. HE text now uses an override. 
[*] Fixed Watcher meal having way too much health
[*] Fixed Hammerhead/Thresher dishes using Sea Weed not being craftable
[*] Fixed Liquor/Jar crates fitting in big crate shelves
[*] Fixed Liquor/Jar shelves being improperly tagged
[*] Fixed Forks/Spoons being combinable
[*] Fixed Hygiene affliction giving Stress to people without Moody Europans enabled.
[*] Fixed Nausea not being up to date with Vanilla (vomiting too much, too early)
[/List]


[b]KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:[/b] 
[*] Bad bot support. Bots cannot heal hunger/thirst without losing health first, so it's not advised giving bots NEEDS
[*] Damage multipliers (like steroids) result in less meat being harvested on corpses
[*] Crafting using stacked bowls/plates will delete any contained bowl/plate, MAKE SURE TO UNSTACK YOUR BOWLS AND PLATES BEFORE CRAFTING
[*] Sprites of items INSIDE items INSIDE tables break and do not match their real position in the inventory
[*] Hygiene affliction washes with clothes on; you are supposed to take clothes off and go in water.
[*] Kitchen Counter cannot receive power from batteries/relays

Misc TODOs:

- Find a way to use lower condition meat since under 50% it can't be used to cook. Maybe throw it out the depth charge tube as decoy? 
- Rework alcoholic to reduce and potentially remove the disoriented from being drunk.
- Change drunkness to not apply disoriented while in water and instead slow the character down
- Skin for Poutine
- Ethanol gives some radiation resistance
- Rework alcohol to invert controls less on lower to mid drunkness like drunknodebuffs and only really get annoying at high drunkness to compensate for high damage resistance.
- Fix meat spoiling in fabricators.
- Endworm and Watcher products giving "concealed" affliction to passivy creatures.
- Make tea kettle storable in cafeteria cart



LIST OF FOODS IDEAS:

- Sauté with Mushrooms, mushroom recipes
- Paté/Foie Gras. Made with Offal, can be spread on bread slices
- Cake + Cake Slice
- Pasta + pasta recipes
- Chewing gum. Made from elastin. Reduces effects of hunger and prevents it from increasing.
- Endeavour's cuppa: minor healing properties, slow metabolism cures psychosis and hallucinations, cures husk 
- Grog! It'd be made of sea water and rum.
- Homemade kvass from water, bread, yeast and sugar.
- Gravy (water, flour, salt, pepper, broth?)
- Cookie jar
- Radioactive sausage cooked in reactor
- Burger Double Deluxe (burger with 2x patties and cheese)
- Box of Fiber Plant cereals, bowl of cereals + milk





Enforced NEEDS:
- Changes to the lua function. Mainly important for singleplayer or multiplayer with bots:
Bots will now only get the "Hungry Europan" talent and thus the hunger and thirst afflictions if you actively control them. Hunger and thirst values will be stored and then set to 0 for characters controlled by a bot. Upon taking back control over the character, the previous hunger and thirst values for this specific character will be restored. Switching into the next round will however delete all stored values that are currently not in use so always switch back to your main character or your hunger and thirst will be reset to 0.

Deathwish: Fix controller component showing when interacting with surgical table on stimpy subs

NEEDS:
- Updated to the latest version of Hungry Europans. See changelogs [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2954998725]HERE[/url]



LongTermPlans:
- Meat Cleaver sharpening + Whetstone - prevents players from harvesting too much meat in one go
- Blender and juices
- Canned food. Canned food from earth, requires can opener or knife to open. Figure out something to do with it.
	Can Opener: 100% | No injuries
	Diving Knife: 80% | 10% chance of lacerations	
- "Constipated" affliction. Caused by eating elastin and prevents you from pooping which will result in constantly increasing organ damage (And/Or custom bowel rupture affliction) until death if not treated.
- Kuru sickness
- "Brain freeze" from eating ice cream too fast
- Meat Chunks cookable and burnable in open fires.
- More recipes and unlockable recipes by recipe items found or bought.
- Abyssal meats?
- Plant based talents. Craftable item that makes items grow faster? Special fertilizer?
- Better Entertainer talents to replace the whole "graduation" copy
- Tier 4 talents for butcher (choice): 1. cannibalism buff with butcher saw. Can directly harvest abyssal meat. | 2. Meat tenderizer hammer (two handed blunt weapon). Will allow meat cleaver to harvest abyssal creature meat after hitting their corpse a few times.
- Assistant "Tasty target" talent for Chef
- Unique Couwola location with cola bottle plant and a locked, run down old part of the station and questline to obtain access to it and grab special bottles for the Couwola Cola collector to obtain his Limited Edition Exosuit.
