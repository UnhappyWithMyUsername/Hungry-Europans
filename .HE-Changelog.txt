[h3]Kitchen Rework Update[/h3]

[b]Additions:[/b]
[List]
[*] Kitchen installation items
[*] Installation blockers (for submarine builders to block specific installation slots of kitchen counters/pantries)
[*] Added Spineling Dip meal
[*] Added Cookie Jar + Cookies
[/List]

[b]Changes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Kitchen fabricators like sink, cutting board, etc. are now placed inside kitchen counters/pantries to install them (It's recommended to do installs while the submarine is stationary/docked)
[*] Kitchen counters/pantries are now disassembled via a UI button while holding a wrench when interacting with them
[*] Cafeterias are disabled in abandoned outposts
[*] Hunger and Thirst no longer cause vitality loss to prevent medical skill gain. Will mess with bot support until the next baro update drops
[*] Starvation and Dying of thirst builds up much faster
[*] Sea Weed gives 2 strips instead of 1, Strips give 4 nori instead of 8, drying Nori in oven is faster
[*] Fryer will smoke if turned on without oil
[*] Fryer uses oil faster
[*] Make egg recipes accept damaged eggs
[*] Give better tags to tableware so bots can pick it up and store it
[*] Increased the speed of eating some foods (burgers, hotdogs, fries, poutine...)
[*] Reduced craving human meat visual effects
[*] Changed Meat Cleaver to harvest Watcher meat from "Watcheroid" group (used by vanilla, update your mods)
[*] Reduced Ice cream melt speed
[*] Drinking a glass/cup entirely will now randomly spawn a dirty glass/cup that needs cleaning
[*] Override Aunt Doris event + use custom Aunt Doris instead of overriding all the NPCs from "customnpcs1". This should improve mod compatibility and reduce conflicts
[*] Optimize ice cream cone and slow down melting of ice cream

[/List]

[b]Fixes:[/b] 
[List]
[*] Hopefully fixed refilling glasses from bottles desyncing in multiplayer
[*] Fixed Dishwasher not appearing in shops and fabricator
[*] Fixed Meat Cleaver not working on Bone threshers
[*] Fixed Meat Cleaver not working on Hammerhead Spawns / Hammerhead Spawn meals should finally be craftable
[*] Fixed bowls/plates breaking too easily (especially in cafeteria cart)
[*] Fixed getting less food buffs than you should if you are hungry
[*] Fixed Moloch Sushi not giving a plate back
[*] Fixed Refrigerator not accepting all eggs
[*] Fixed recipes using UNPOPPED popnuts instead of popped
[/List]


[b]KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:[/b]
[*] Bad bot support. Bots cannot heal hunger/thirst without losing health first, so it's not advised giving bots NEEDS
[*] Fabricators delete ingredient items instead of setting their condition to 0, preventing ingredients from turning empty/dirty 
[*] Poisons are not working for fork/spoon/fingerfood meals
[*] Sprites of items INSIDE items INSIDE tables break and do not match their real position in the inventory

Misc TODOs:

- Rework alcoholic to reduce and potentially remove the disoriented from being drunk.
- Change drunkness to not apply disoriented while in water and instead slow the character down
- Ethanol gives some radiation resistance
- Rework alcohol to invert controls less on lower to mid drunkness like drunknodebuffs and only really get annoying at high drunkness to compensate for high damage resistance.
- Fix meat spoiling in fabricators.
- Make tea kettle storable in cafeteria cart



LIST OF FOODS IDEAS:

- Mantis/Orange boy meat and meals, basically a lobster/crab
Mantis Surimi, Tempura (fried food)... 
- More Blender recipes
- More Offal recipes
- More Mushroom recipes?
- Cookie jar
- Cake + Slices
- Pasta + pasta recipes
- Chewing gum. Made from elastin. Slows down hunger but accelerates need to defecate if too high?
- Endeavour's cuppa: minor healing properties, slow metabolism cures psychosis and hallucinations, cures husk 
- Grog! It'd be made of sea water and rum.
- Homemade kvass from water, bread, yeast and sugar.
- Burger Double Deluxe (burger with 2x patties and cheese)





Enforced NEEDS:
- Changes to the lua function. Mainly important for singleplayer or multiplayer with bots:
Bots will now only get the "Hungry Europan" talent and thus the hunger and thirst afflictions if you actively control them. Hunger and thirst values will be stored and then set to 0 for characters controlled by a bot. Upon taking back control over the character, the previous hunger and thirst values for this specific character will be restored. Switching into the next round will however delete all stored values that are currently not in use so always switch back to your main character or your hunger and thirst will be reset to 0.

Deathwish: Fix controller component showing when interacting with surgical table on stimpy subs

NEEDS:
- Updated to the latest version of Hungry Europans. See changelogs [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2954998725]HERE[/url]



LongTermPlans:
- Meat Cleaver sharpening + Whetstone - prevents players from harvesting too much meat in one go
- Blender and juices
- Canned food. Canned food from earth, requires can opener or knife to open. Figure out something to do with it.
	Can Opener: 100% | No injuries
	Diving Knife: 80% | 10% chance of lacerations	
- "Constipated" affliction. Caused by eating elastin and prevents you from pooping which will result in constantly increasing organ damage (And/Or custom bowel rupture affliction) until death if not treated.
- Kuru sickness
- "Brain freeze" from eating ice cream too fast
- Meat Chunks cookable and burnable in open fires.
- More recipes and unlockable recipes by recipe items found or bought.
- Abyssal meats?
- Plant based talents. Craftable item that makes items grow faster? Special fertilizer?
- Better Entertainer talents to replace the whole "graduation" copy
- Tier 4 talents for butcher (choice): 1. cannibalism buff with butcher saw. Can directly harvest abyssal meat. | 2. Meat tenderizer hammer (two handed blunt weapon). Will allow meat cleaver to harvest abyssal creature meat after hitting their corpse a few times.
- Assistant "Tasty target" talent for Chef
- Unique Couwola location with cola bottle plant and a locked, run down old part of the station and questline to obtain access to it and grab special bottles for the Couwola Cola collector to obtain his Limited Edition Exosuit.
